MkModule
========

A shell script that builds a Drupal module skeleton

Use
---
Just run the script and enter your module information when prompted

What does it do?
----------------
Almost everything! When the script completes, you will be left with an enableable module 
that is already set up with a bunch of defaults: a template, javascript and css files, a 
default menu, a database table and more! Don't need all that? Go ahead and scrap anything
you don't need -- either in the bash script or in your newly carved out module!
